# Tens
Tens is a Mobile iOS application.
The game is currently only formatted for the iPhone SE.

How to play:

The game begins by giving you 9 random numbers, between 1 and 9. Before time runs out, you must select three numbers that satisfy the following condition:
  num1 + num2 + num3 == 10 or num1 - num2 + num3 == 10.
  
  Each time you hit a valid combination of three numbers, you are awarded a point, the three numbers you chose are replaced by three new random numbers, and the timer resets. As you collect more points, the timer gets quicker.
  
 If you hit a combination that does not sum to 10, or if you run out of time, you lose. 
 
 This project was written in Swift using Xcode. To open the application, open the xCode project file in the
 Tens.xcodeproj.zip using Xcode, and run the project on the iPhone SE simulator.
